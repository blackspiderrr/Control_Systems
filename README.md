# Control Systems

This repository contains the laboratory work for EIE3551 **Control Systems** course at Tongji University. 

## 📂 Laboratory Topics

The coursework covers the following key areas:

1.  **MATLAB Fundamentals**: Common commands for control system analysis.
2.  **System Modeling I**: Single-module model construction and response analysis.
3.  **System Modeling II**: Multi-module model modeling and interaction analysis.
4.  **Signal Processing**: Data sampling and Zero-Order Hold (ZOH) mechanisms.
5.  **Digital Controller Design**: PID control and equivalent discretization of continuous controllers.
6.  **Time-Delay Systems**: Controller design for systems with time delays.
7.  **Deadbeat Control**: Design and implementation of minimum-beat (deadbeat) controllers.
